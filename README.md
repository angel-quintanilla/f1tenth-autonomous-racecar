# SETUP
This Repo is meant to be cloned into your ``~/ws/gym-one/`` directory, as the ``f1tenth_gym_ros`` directory has machine specific paths in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file, so we'll avoid that headache :). 

## After Cloning into ``~/ws/gym-one``
As mentioned, ``ws/gym-one/f1tenth_gym_ros/docker-compose.yml`` will need to be updated to include the directory, update volumes with these 
```
  - /your/path/to/ws/gym-one/f1tenth-cs489/safety_node/:/sim_ws/src/safety_node
  - /your/path/to/ws/gym-one/f1tenth-cs489/wall_follow/:/sim_ws/src/wall_follow
  - /your/path/to/ws/gym-one/f1tenth-cs489/gap_follow/:/sim_ws/src/gap_follow
  - /your/path/to/ws/gym-one/f1tenth-cs489/pure_pursuit/:/sim_ws/src/pure_pursuit
```

- Notice for your prior entries, such as safety_node and wall_follow, you just need to add the ``f1tenth-autonomous-racecar/ directory`` in the middle there, 
- ``.:/sim_ws/src/f1tenth_gym_ros`` at line 29 should remain unchanged 


Now you're good to cook üë®‚Äçüç≥
